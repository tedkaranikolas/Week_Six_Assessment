##Angular and MongoDB Code Challenge

###Instructions

This challenge is intended to see how you are progressing with Angular, Mongo, Node, and Express.

###Your Hero Tracker
The Department of Superhero Knowledge needs an app to help track super hero aliases and powers. You are going to build them this app with Angular and MongoDB. This app will have the following features. Please do not add anything. Focus on the functionality listed.

###Hero Entry
This will have a form to fill out and create new heroes. Each hero will have the following information on their record:

* `alias` (this is their superhero name)
* `first_name`
* `last_name`
* `city`
* `power_name`

Store these in a Collection called Heroes with Mongo.

###Super Power Select
The above mentioned view will utilize a list of known super powers to populate a select list drop down. Each super power has just one field called: `power_name`

Enter the following into your database of super powers:

* Invisibility
* Flight
* Super Speed
* Heat Vision
* Super Strength
* Accelerated Healing
* Power Blast
* Animal Affinity

Use the `power_name` string field as the value in your option elements. This would store the string on the Hero object.

###Hero Listing & Removal
This should show a list of heroes, displaying all the information from the entry captured in the view before. Each listing should have a button to delete the listing from the database.

###Node Server
Your app will need a Node/Express server that can serve static files. It should make use of route modules and run on port 4242.

###Database
If you follow the naming guidelines above for your Collection, there is no need to submit any information about your database.
